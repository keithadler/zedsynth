**A versatile software synthesizer.** It is WhySynth, by Sean Bolton,
carried forward under a new name with his blessing. Four oscillators with
eleven modes: minBLEP, wavecycle, chorused wavecycle, asynchronous granular,
three kinds of FM, waveshaper, noise, PADsynth, and phase distortion. Two
filters with ten modes. Three LFOs, five envelopes, a modulation mixer, and
effects. Almost four hundred factory patches, many of them interpretations of
Kawai K4 and Ensoniq SQ-80 sounds. Free software since 2005.

The same synth, revived for 2026: it builds as a **CLAP** and an **LV2**
plugin on Linux, macOS and Windows, with CMake, tests and CI, and a command
line renderer. FFTW, DSSI, liblo, ALSA and GTK are no longer required. The
DSSI plugin and its GTK2 editor still build on Linux when their libraries are
installed.

**On the name.** This project was WhySynth through version 2.1.4. Sean Bolton,
who wrote it, is taking his own WhySynth work in a different direction, toward
Cortex-M7 hardware, and asked that this line of development take a name of its
own. It follows the joke the family was already telling: Xsynth, then
Xsynth-DSSI, then WhySynth, now ZedSynth. Your old patches still load, and
`WHYSYNTH_DEFAULT_BANK` still works.

## Download

Builds for every platform are attached to each
[release](https://github.com/keithadler/zedsynth/releases). Unzip and copy:

| Platform | CLAP | LV2 | Audio Unit | Standalone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.clap/` | `~/.lv2/` | | `ZedSynth`, run it |
| macOS | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/` | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/LV2/` | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/` | `ZedSynth.app`, anywhere |
| Windows | `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\CLAP\` | `%APPDATA%\LV2\` | | `ZedSynth.exe`, anywhere |

**No DAW?** The standalone is ZedSynth in a window of its own. It opens on the default audio
output, listens on every MIDI input it finds, and has an *Audio/MIDI Settings* panel for the
output device and sample rate. Plug in a keyboard and play. It has no editor, so choose
patches with MIDI program change from the factory bank, or set `WHYSYNTH_DEFAULT_BANK` to a
`.WhySynth` file before starting it (see below).

**On Windows the window is small on purpose.** ZedSynth has no controls to show, so the window
is a short note saying it is running. *Audio/MIDI Settings*, and saving or loading its state,
are in the menu behind the icon at the top left of the window; right-clicking the title bar
opens the same menu. Versions before 2.1.4 showed only the title bar, which looked like a
failed launch and was not one.

**Logic Pro and GarageBand** use the Audio Unit. After copying it, restart
Logic; it appears under AU Instruments as Keith Adler > ZedSynth. It passes
Apple's `auval`, which is the check Logic runs before listing a plugin.

The macOS build is unsigned. If macOS refuses to load it, remove the
quarantine flag once:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/ZedSynth.clap
```

## Using it

ZedSynth has no window of its own yet. Your host shows its parameters, all
196 of them plus polyphony, voice mode and glide mode, grouped by module
(Osc1, VCF2, EG3 and so on), and you play it over MIDI.

**CLAP.** The *Program* parameter selects a patch from the loaded bank, and
a MIDI program change does the same. Selecting a patch rewrites every
parameter, and the plugin tells the host so its display follows. Use the
host's preset browser to load any `.WhySynth` file as a new bank (the plugin
implements `clap.preset-load`). The whole bank is saved with your session.

**LV2.** The factory patches are shipped as LV2 presets, generated from the
bank at build time, so they appear in your host's preset list. Any patch file
can be turned into presets with `zedsynth-lv2-gen presets out.ttl file.WhySynth`.

**Audio Unit.** The AU is the CLAP wrapped by
[clap-wrapper](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-wrapper), so it has the
same parameters and the Program parameter, and Logic's own preset system
saves the whole bank with the project.

**Both.** Set `WHYSYNTH_DEFAULT_BANK` to a patch file to load it on every
instance. Mod wheel, pressure, key and velocity are modulation sources; the
sustain pedal, all-notes-off and all-sound-off are honoured.

The PADsynth and wavetable oscillators render their tables on a background
thread the first time a patch asks for them, so a patch may take a moment
before it sounds. That is how the original worked too.

## The command line renderer

`zedsynth-render` plays notes or a whole MIDI file through the engine and
writes a stereo WAV. No host, no audio device.

```bash
zedsynth-render --list
zedsynth-render --program 12 --note 48 --note 55 --note 60 --out chord.wav
zedsynth-render --bank patches/more_K4_interpretations.WhySynth --midi song.mid --out song.wav
```

## Building

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

On Windows, build with MSVC (the Visual Studio Build Tools) and `-G Ninja` to get the
standalone; clap-wrapper's Windows shell is C++/WinRT, which MinGW cannot compile. A MinGW
build still produces the plugins and the tool.

That produces `build/ZedSynth.clap`, `build/lv2/zedsynth.lv2/`,
`build/zedsynth-render`, the standalone in `build/wrapped/`, and on macOS
`build/wrapped/ZedSynth.component`. The CLAP and LV2 headers are fetched by CMake if not
installed; KISS FFT is vendored. On Linux, installing `dssi-dev liblo-dev
libgtk2.0-dev libasound2-dev` also builds the original DSSI plugin and GTK2
editor. Installing `lilv-dev` (or `brew install lilv`) enables the LV2 host
test.

Options: `-DWHYSYNTH_BUILD_CLAP`, `-DWHYSYNTH_BUILD_LV2`,
`-DWHYSYNTH_BUILD_DSSI`, `-DWHYSYNTH_BUILD_TOOLS`, `-DWHYSYNTH_BUILD_TESTS`
(all on).

## Embedding the engine

`src/whysynth_engine.h` is a small C API with no plugin framework attached:
create an engine at a sample rate, set parameters by port number, feed it
events with frame offsets, render stereo float. Patch loading, the bank,
state save and load, and MIDI parsing are all there. The CLAP plugin and the
renderer are each a few hundred lines on top of it; the LV2 plugin sits one
level down on `whysynth_core.h`, which speaks LADSPA-style ports directly.

## What changed in 2.0

- CLAP and LV2 plugins on three platforms, plus an Audio Unit on macOS for
  Logic and GarageBand, with per-platform CI and a `clap-validator` pass on
  every commit.
- CMake replaces autotools.
- FFTW replaced by a vendored KISS FFT (BSD) behind two small wrappers; the
  engine has no external dependencies beyond pthreads.
- The table-rendering worker thread is woken through a condition variable
  instead of a pipe and `poll()`, which is what made a Windows build possible.
- The engine is separated from the plugin API and covered by tests: patch
  files in every version of the format, rendering of every factory patch,
  voice management, state, and sample rates.
- Patches can be read from memory and written back to text without a GUI,
  which is what session state is built on.
- `WHYSYNTH_DEFAULT_BANK` loads a bank on instantiation.
- Several latent crashes in the oscillators at extreme pitches or sample
  rates are fixed, and instances at different sample rates can coexist.

Not yet: a graphical editor for the CLAP and LV2 plugins. The GTK2 editor
still builds on Linux for DSSI hosts.

## Credits

**ZedSynth is Sean Bolton's WhySynth**, continued under a new name at his
suggestion and with his blessing. Nearly all of the synthesis here is his.

WhySynth was written by Sean Bolton, drawing on Xsynth-DSSI, hexter, Csound,
Mats Olsson's MSS, Fons Adriaensen's filters, Nasca Octavian Paul's PADsynth
algorithm, Juhana Sadeharju's plate reverb, and wavecycle data resynthesized
from Claude Kaber's Virtual K4 and //christian's SQ-80 work. See
[AUTHORS](AUTHORS). The port to CMake and the modern plugin formats, and
everything since, is by Keith Adler.

The upstream project is at
[theabolton/whysynth](https://github.com/theabolton/whysynth), where Sean
Bolton's own work continues.

The original README, with the voice architecture, the oscillator modes and
the wavetable guide, is kept as
[docs/README-20170701.rst](docs/README-20170701.rst).
